Every graph must have LR (Left to Right) direction. It consists of nodes and edges.
Each node has following structure: "name"[attributes]
There are 5 different types of nodes: start event, end event, task, exclusive gateway and parallel gateway.
Each node has its specific attributes based on the type of the node. Example:
  start node:        "start_1"[shape=circle label=""];
  end node:          "end_1"[shape=doublecircle label=""];
In both start and end nodes labels are always empty. Example:
  task:              "task label"[shape=rectangle];
Task labels are always unique. Example:
  exclusive gateway: "seg_1"[shape=diamond label="X"];
  parallel gateway:  "spg_1"[shape=diamond label="AND"];

Gateways are not tasks. They merely indicate that the control flow of the process is splitted or merged.
Following names "seg_1" and "meg_1" should be used for splitting and merging exclusive gateways.
Following names "spg_1" and "mpg_1" should be used for splitting and merging parallel gateways.

Every time when new start, end or gateways node is used, the counter should be incrimented at 1.

All elements are connected with each other with the help of the edges.
  edge: ->
Examples:
  "start" -> "task 1"
  "task 1" -> "task 2"

If there are conditions or annotations, it is necessary to use text on links (i.e., edge labels).
Exmaple:
  edge label:  "task 1" -> "task 2"[label="condition 1"]
